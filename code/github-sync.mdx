## What is GitHub?

- **Git** is a version control system — it tracks changes in your code.  
- **GitHub** is the most widely used platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.  

By connecting your Fimo project to GitHub, your code and its history live in a Git repository. This gives you transparency, collaboration tools, and flexibility beyond the Fimo editor.

## Why sync with GitHub?

    Track every change with Git. Roll back anytime. GitHub provides an external backup.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Collaboration" icon="users">
    Use pull requests, branches, and reviews. Teammates follow code history transparently.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-time sync" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Edits in Fimo push to GitHub. GitHub updates pull back instantly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Workflow integration" icon="sitemap">
    Connect GitHub tools — issues, CI/CD, and Actions — with Fimo’s editor and AI.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
    With GitHub connected, you can also deploy your site anywhere. Keep in mind: hosting outside of Fimo means you lose real-time collaboration, comments, and in-preview content editing.
