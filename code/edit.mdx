The **Edit online** feature lets you update your site’s code directly in Fimo’s built-in editor. No setup required, everything happens in your browser.

## What you can do

- **View files**: open and explore your project’s codebase  
- **Edit code**: update logic, styles, or layouts instantly  
- **Delete files**: remove code you no longer need  
- **Real-time preview**: see changes applied right away in the Preview window  

## How saving works

Every change you make is saved instantly. Behind the scenes, Fimo groups your edits into a single commit after **1 minute of inactivity**, so your history stays clean and easy to follow.

<Note>
Fimo relies on **Git** under the hood. This follows development best practices and makes it easy for engineers to jump into your project for advanced or custom development.
