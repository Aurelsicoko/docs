## What is GitHub?

- **Git** is a version control system — it tracks changes in your code.  
- **GitHub** is the most widely used platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.  

By connecting your Fimo project to GitHub, your code and its history live in a Git repository. This gives you transparency, collaboration tools, and flexibility beyond the Fimo editor.

## Why sync with GitHub?

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version history & backup" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Every change in your Fimo project is tracked.  
    GitHub provides an external backup and lets you roll back to any version.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Collaboration" icon="users">
    Developers can work with familiar GitHub workflows: pull requests, branches, and reviews.  
    Non-technical teammates can still follow the history for transparency.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-time sync" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Edits in Fimo push to GitHub.  
    Updates from GitHub pull back into Fimo.  
    Both stay in sync automatically.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Workflow integration" icon="sitemap">
    Use GitHub’s ecosystem — issues, CI/CD, and GitHub Actions — alongside Fimo’s editor and AI.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Deployment flexibility" icon="globe">
    With GitHub connected, you can deploy your site on your own infrastructure or platform of choice.  
    You’re not locked into Fimo hosting.
