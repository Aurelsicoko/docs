The **Code** tab lets you see and manage the code that powers your site.  
Every project generated by Fimo comes with a complete codebase you can explore directly in the browser.

## What you can do

- **View code**: browse the files and understand how your site is structured  
- **Edit code**: make changes directly in the online editor, no setup needed  
- **Delete code**: remove files you no longer need  
- **Real-time updates**: edits are applied instantly in Preview so you can test changes right away  

<Tip>
The Code tab works just like a lightweight IDE in your browser — fast, collaborative, and always connected to your project.
