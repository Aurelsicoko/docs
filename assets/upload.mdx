## Where to upload

- **Root library**: upload files at the top level of your Assets tab  
- **Folders**: upload directly into a specific folder for better organization  

## Upload from Preview

You donâ€™t need to open the Assets tab every time. From the **Preview window**, you can:

- Select an image or placeholder  
- Open the side panel  
- Upload a new file by pasting a URL, picking from the Media Library, or choosing from **Unsplash**  

<Note>
Any file you upload is instantly added to the Media Library and available for reuse across your project.
