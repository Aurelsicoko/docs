You can upload one or many files at once into the **Assets** library.  
Supported formats include images, videos, audio, and common documents.

## Supported formats

- **Images**: SVG, WebP, PNG, JPEG, GIF  
- **Videos**: MP4 (H.264 compression), WebM (short clips)  
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, AAC  
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV  

<Tip>
Optimized formats like **WebP** for images and **MP4 (H.264)** for videos keep your site fast and lightweight.

## Where to upload

- **Root library**: upload files at the top level of your Assets tab  
- **Folders**: upload directly into a specific folder for better organization  

## Upload from Preview

You don’t need to open the Assets tab every time. From the **Preview window**, you can:

- Select an image or placeholder  
- Open the side panel  
- Upload a new file by pasting a URL, picking from the Media Library, or choosing from **Unsplash**  

<Note>
Any file you upload is instantly added to the Media Library and available for reuse across your project.

## Limits

Here are the upload limits to keep in mind:

- **Maximum file size**: up to **5 GB per file**  
- **Parallel uploads**: up to **10 files at once**  
- **File types**: only supported formats (see above)  
- **Concurrent writes**: avoid uploading multiple files with the same name at the same time  

<Note>
There’s no practical limit on the total number of files you can store. Each project comes with its own dedicated media library. However, Fimo actively monitors usage and may reach out to projects that abuse the system under our **Fair Use Policy**.
