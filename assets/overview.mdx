The **Assets** tab is your media library. Every image, video, song, or file you upload or generate with Fimo is stored here for reuse across your site.  

Each asset includes auto-generated **alternative text** and **captions** for better SEO. Rich metadata like type, size, and creation date are always available.

## Key features

- **Upload anything**: images, videos, songs, and files.  
- **Automatic SEO**: captions and alt text are generated for you.  
- **Metadata included**: view file type, size, dimensions, and more.  
- **Organize with folders**: create folders, move assets, and keep your library structured.  
- **Bulk actions**: move or delete multiple files at once.  
- **Sorting options**: reorder by date, type, file size, or name.  

## Folder structure

On the left side of the library, you’ll find a **tree view** of your folders.  
This makes it easy to:  

- Navigate large libraries  
- Group assets by project or type  
- Quickly move files between folders  

<Note>
Assets are shared across your entire project. Once uploaded, they can be reused on any page or entry without re-uploading.
