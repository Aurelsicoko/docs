The **Preview** is your workspace for building and experimenting with your site.
Changes show up instantly here, while your published site stays safe and unchanged.

## Preview vs Production

<Tip>
Preview looks like your site, but it is private to your team. 
Production is the public version that visitors see.
</Tip>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Preview" icon="eye">
    <ul>
      <li>Private to your team.</li>
      <li>Live updates as you edit.</li>
      <li>Safe sandbox for experiments.</li>
      <li>Ideal for reviews and QA.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Production" icon="globe">
    <ul>
      <li>Public and SEO-visible.</li>
      <li>Read-only snapshot from last publish.</li>
      <li>No changes until you publish again.</li>
      <li>Optimized and stable for visitors.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
Publishing creates a read-only snapshot of your website. Production remains unchanged until you publish the latest Preview state.
