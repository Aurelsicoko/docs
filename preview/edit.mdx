**Edit mode** lets you update your site directly in Preview without using AI credits. Click any element to change its text, image, or style. All edits are saved in the built-in CMS and Media Library, and you can manage them later in [Content](/content/introduction) or [Assets](/assets/introduction).

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Edit mode">
    In Preview, click **Edit** (or press <kbd>E</kbd>).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an element">
    Click a text block, image, card, list, or other component. Editable fields appear in the side panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update content or styles">
    <Columns cols={3}>
      <Card title="Text" icon="text-height">
        Type inline for short copy. Use the WYSIWYG editor for long-form content.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Images" icon="image">
        Replace by pasting a URL, picking from the Media Library, or choosing from Unsplash.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Styles" icon="sliders">
        Tweak typography, colors, spacing, borders, and more from the style panel.
      </Card>
    </Columns>
    You can also describe the change in AI chat; the result is the same.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review your changes">
    Edits are saved automatically in the CMS and visible in Preview.  
    Production does not change until you publish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Text editing

For short text, click and type inline.  
For long text blocks, use the **WYSIWYG editor** with:

- Paragraph and heading levels  
- Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough  
- Code snippets and links  

<Tip>
Prefer prompts? Ask AI to rewrite, shorten, translate, or adjust tone.  
You can refine manually afterward in Edit mode.
</Tip>

## Image editing

When an image is selected, the side panel lets you:

- **Paste a URL** to replace the image  
- **Pick from the Media Library**  
- **Search Unsplash** for free, high-quality images  

<Note>
Image sources and alt text are stored in the Media Library so you can reuse assets across pages.
</Note>

## Styling

Selecting a component opens the **style panel**. Common options include:

- **Typography**: font family, weight, size, alignment, letter spacing, text decoration  
- **Color**: text color and background color  
- **Spacing**: margin and padding  
- **Borders**: color, style, width, radius  

<Tip>
You can ask AI to restyle components (for example, “make this card more compact with tighter spacing and a subtle border”). Edit mode lets you fine-tune the details visually.
</Tip>

<Note>
All changes made in Edit mode affect Preview only. Your live site updates when you publish.
