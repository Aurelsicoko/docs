# Edit mode

**Edit mode** lets you update your site directly in Preview without using AI credits.  
Click on any element to change its text, image, or style. All edits are saved in Fimo’s built-in CMS, so you can revisit them later in the **Content** section.

## Why use Edit mode?

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Manual control" icon="pen-to-square">

  </Card>

  <Card title="Saved to the CMS" icon="database">
    Every change is stored automatically. You can revisit and edit the content later in the CMS.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Style flexibility" icon="palette">
    Customize typography, colors, spacing, and borders visually in the style panel.
  </Card>

  <Card title="AI or manual" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    All parameters you edit here can also be changed through the AI chat if you prefer prompts.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Edit mode">
    In Preview, click the **Edit** button (or press <kbd>E</kbd>).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an element">
    Click on text, an image, a card, or a list. Editable fields will appear in the side panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update content or styles">
    - For text: type directly or use the WYSIWYG editor for long-form content.  
    - For images: paste a new URL, choose from your Media Library, or pick from Unsplash.  
    - For styles: adjust fonts, sizes, colors, spacing, or borders using the style panel.  
    - Or, switch to AI chat and describe the change in natural language.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review your changes">
    Edits are saved automatically in the CMS and visible in Preview.  
    Your production site stays unchanged until you publish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Text editing

For short text, click and type directly.  
For long text blocks (such as paragraphs or blog posts), a **WYSIWYG editor** is available with options like:

- Paragraph and heading styles  
- Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough  
- Code snippets and links  

This makes it easy to write and format content without leaving Preview.

## Image editing

When selecting an image, you can:

- **Paste a URL** to replace it  
- **Pick from your Media Library** for assets you’ve already uploaded  
- **Use Unsplash** to add free, high-quality images instantly  

<Note>
Whether you edit text, images, or styles manually, the same changes can also be made using the AI chat. Choose the workflow that feels most natural.
