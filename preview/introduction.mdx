# Preview

The **Preview** is your team’s workspace for building and experimenting with your website.  
Every change you make here is reflected instantly in the Preview, but your published site remains safe and unchanged.

## Why use Preview?

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Safe by design" icon="shield">
    Each time you publish, Fimo creates a **read-only snapshot** of your site.  
    Your production website is never affected until you decide to deploy again.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Live collaboration" icon="users">
    Work together in real time. Teammates can edit, style, and comment directly inside the Preview.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Instant updates" icon="bolt">
    Change content, swap assets, or add pages — everything refreshes instantly in the Preview.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Flexible editing" icon="palette">
    Use AI to generate changes or adjust details manually with the style and content editors.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## What’s next?

The Preview workspace includes three powerful modes to refine your website:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Edit Mode"
    icon="pen-to-square"
    href="/preview/edit"
  >
    Make content and style changes directly in your site.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Comment Mode"
    icon="comment"
    href="/preview/comment"
  >
    Leave feedback and collaborate with your team.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Responsive Mode"
    icon="mobile-screen"
    href="/preview/responsive"
  >
    Test and adjust your site across different screen sizes.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
  The Preview is your safe sandbox. Explore ideas, collaborate with your team, and test changes freely — your production site only updates when you publish.
