**Responsive mode** lets you test how your site looks on different devices and screen sizes. Switch between desktop, tablet, and mobile, adjust zoom, and rotate devices horizontally or vertically.

<Note>
Responsive mode works alongside other tools.  
You can edit content, add comments, or refresh the preview window while viewing different devices.
