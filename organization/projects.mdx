The **Projects** page in an organization lists every project you can access.  
This includes both the projects you created yourself and those that have been shared with you.

## What can you do here?

- **Browse projects**: See all projects in your organization, whether you own them or were invited to collaborate.  
- **Search**: Quickly find a project by name.  
- **Public or private**: Some projects are public to the organization, while others are private and only visible to invited members.  
- **Switch easily**: Move between projects without leaving your organization workspace.

For a deeper look at what a project is and what it contains, see the [Project overview](/project/overview).
