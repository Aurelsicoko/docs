## Roles in an organization

Every member has a role that defines their permissions:

| Role    | What they can do |
|---------|------------------|
| **Member** | Access projects and use basic features. Ideal for collaborators who only need to work inside projects. |
| **Admin**  | Manage members and organization settings. Perfect for people who help with structure and administration. |
| **Owner**  | Full access, including billing control. Reserved for the main account holder or organization leads. |

<Note>
    You can have multiple **Admins** or **Owners** in the same organization, depending on your needs.
</Note>

## Why it matters?

- Keeps access to projects organized and secure  
- Makes it easy to bring new teammates on board
