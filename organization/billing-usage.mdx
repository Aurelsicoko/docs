Fimo keeps billing simple. Plans are billed at the **organization level**, which means that credits and bandwidth are shared across all projects in your organization:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Usage limits

- **Credits**: Used for AI features. Plans include credits each month. Extra usage is billed as overages.
- **Bandwidth**: Free includes 5 GB/month, Premium includes 100 GB/month. Extra is billed automatically. 

## Overages

If you exceed your included usage, Fimo bills extra usage automatically in the next invoice.  
- Extra bandwidth: $10/month per 100 GB:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- AI credits: billed per additional usage  

Your projects stay online even if you go over limits, billing adjusts automatically.

## Notifications

Fimo notifies you before you hit limits:  
- At **85% usage** → in-app banner + email reminder  .
- At **100% usage** → confirmation and guidance on upgrade/overages.  

## Billing & management

- Upgrade or downgrade at any time (downgrade only if usage fits limits)
- Invoices available in your Stripe portal  

## Fair Use

While there are no hard caps on total usage, we **monitor for abuse**. If a project exceeds reasonable use under our **Fair Use Policy**, we will reach out to find the best solution together.

<Note>
Plans, limits, and overages apply at the **organization level**, not per project.
