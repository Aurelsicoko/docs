Fimo keeps billing simple. Plans are billed at the **organization level**, which means that credits and bandwidth are shared across all projects in your organization.  

## Plans

## Usage limits

Fimo is an **AI-native product**. Under the hood, AI agents work for you in real time, for example, when you upload an asset, captions and alternative text are generated automatically. These actions consume **credits**, and every plan includes a monthly credit allowance.  

- **Credits**: Required for AI features (e.g. generating content, translating, styling, auto-captioning assets). Plans include credits each month. Extra usage is billed as overages.  
- **Bandwidth**: Free includes 5 GB/month, Premium includes 100 GB/month. Extra is billed automatically.  

<Note>
On the **Free plan**, limits are hard. Once you run out of credits, you must upgrade to continue using AI features.
</Note>

## Overages

If you exceed your included usage, Fimo bills extra usage automatically in the next invoice:  
- Extra bandwidth: $10/month per 100 GB  
- AI credits: $1 per 3,000 credits  

Your projects stay online even if you go over limits, billing adjusts automatically.

## Notifications

Fimo notifies you before you hit limits:  
- At **85% usage** → in-app banner + email reminder  
- At **100% usage** → confirmation and guidance on upgrade/overages  

<Note>
    Notifications are **not customizable** for now and cannot be configured per project or user.
</Note>

## Billing & management

- Upgrade or downgrade at any time (downgrade only if usage fits limits)  
- Invoices available in the **Organization > Billing** page.

## Fair Use

While there are no hard caps on total usage, we **monitor for abuse**. If a project exceeds reasonable use under our **Fair Use Policy**, we will reach out to find the best solution together.
