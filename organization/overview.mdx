An **organization** in Fimo is the space where people and projects come together. When you sign up, Fimo automatically creates a personal organization for you. In most cases, an organization represents a team or company, where members can collaborate on shared projects.

## Why use an organization?

- **Centralized workspace**: All your projects live under one organization.  
- **Invite teammates**: Add members to work with you on projects.  
- **Flexible roles**: Assign each member a role with the right permissions.  
- **Multiple organizations**: A user can belong to several organizations at once, and easily switch between them.  
- **Scales with you**: Start solo, then grow into a team or company setup.  

<Note>
Every user belongs to at least one organization, either their own or one they’ve been invited to. Inviting others gives them access to the projects of your organization, but not to other organizations you belong to.
