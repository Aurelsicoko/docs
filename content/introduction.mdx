The **Content** tab is your built-in CMS. Every piece of text, image, and link generated by Fimo is editable and stored here, making it easy to collaborate and manage content at scale.

## Key features

- **Built-in CMS** — All site content is editable by default, no setup needed.  
- **Real-time edits** — Changes appear instantly across teammates’ preview windows.  
- **AI credits saved** — Fix typos or small edits directly in the CMS.  
- **Scalable management** — Prepare for advanced workflows like translations or A/B testing.  

## Why it matters?

<Tip>
<strong>Real-time collaboration.</strong> If <strong>User A</strong> updates content, <strong>User B</strong> sees it instantly in their preview window. No refresh needed.

## Collections and Entries

To keep content organized, the CMS uses two building blocks:

## <Icon icon="folder-open"/> Collections  
Think of a Collection as a **container**. It defines the structure of content, like "Blog posts" or "Team members". Each Collection has a set of fields (title, image, link, etc.).

## <Icon icon="list"/> Entries  
An Entry is a **single item** inside a Collection. For example: one blog article, or one team member profile. Each Entry follows the structure defined by its Collection.
