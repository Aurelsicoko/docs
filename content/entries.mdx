An **Entry** is like baking a cake from a recipe. The **Collection** is the recipe (it defines the ingredients: title, image, description). Each **Entry** is one cake you create — and you can bake as many as you need.  

## What you can do

Inside any collection, you can manage its entries:

- **Add entries**: create new items following the collection’s structure (e.g., a new blog post, product feature, or team member).  
- **Edit entries**: update text, images, and links directly. You can also replace images by selecting one from the **Media Library**.  
- **Delete entries**: remove one or multiple items. Bulk delete is available for faster cleanup.
