A **Collection** works like a recipe: it defines the list of ingredients you need to create something. For example, a blog post collection might include a title, image, author, and body text. Each new blog post is an **Entry**, just like baking another cake from the same recipe.

## How collections are created?

You don’t need to set up collections yourself. Fimo analyzes your website structure and:

- Suggests the right collections based on your pages  
- Automatically creates entries to fill new pages with content  

This way, your site always has the content it needs in the right format.

<Note>
Collection structures can’t be edited yet. They are generated automatically to match your website’s requirements.
</Note>

## What you can do?

In the **Content** tab, you can:

- See all collections created for your site  
- Enter a collection to browse its entries  
- Search, filter, and sort entries by fields like title, order, or creation date  
- Open an entry to view and edit its content
