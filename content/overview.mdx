The **Content** tab is your built-in CMS. Every piece of text, image, and link generated by Fimo is editable and stored here, making it easy to collaborate and manage content at scale.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Built-in CMS" icon="database">
    All site content is editable by default.  
    No setup needed, everything lives in the Content tab.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-time updates" icon="bolt">
    Changes appear instantly across teammates’ preview windows.  
    Edit once, see it everywhere.
  </Card>

  <Card title="AI credits saved" icon="hand-holding-dollar">

<Callout icon="bolt" color="var(--primary)" iconType="solid">
  <strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> — If <strong>User A</strong> updates content, <strong>User B</strong> sees it instantly in their preview window. No refresh needed.

## Collections and Entries

To keep content organized, the CMS uses two building blocks:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Collections" icon="folder-open">
    Think of a Collection as a **container**.  
    It defines the structure of content, like “Blog posts” or “Team members.”  
    Each Collection has a set of fields (title, image, link, etc.).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Entries" icon="list">
    An Entry is a **single item** inside a Collection.  
    For example: one blog article, or one team member profile.  
    Each Entry follows the structure defined by its Collection.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
Collections = categories of content.  
Entries = the individual items inside those categories.
</Note>
