Fimo is built for **seamless collaboration**. Thanks to a powerful real-time infrastructure, every change you make in **Preview**, **Content**, **Assets**, or **Code** is instantly visible to other collaborators, no matter where they are.

## How to invite teammates?

- Click the **Invite** button in the top-right corner of your project.  
- Enter an email address or copy the project link to share access.  
- Assign a permission to each person you invite.  

<Note>
When someone joins a project, they do **not** automatically join your organization. This makes it easy to collaborate with external people while keeping your organization private. For organization-wide management, see the [Organization overview](/organization/overview).
</Note>

## What roles can I assign?

Each collaborator can be given a role with specific permissions:

- **Can View**: read-only visibility. Ideal for stakeholders or reviewers.  
- **Can Comment**: view and leave feedback with comments. Great for reviewers.  
- **Can Edit**: full editing rights across content, assets, code, and styles. Perfect for contributors.  
- **Full Access**: all permissions, including publishing, inviting, and managing roles. For project owners or maintainers.  

<Tip>
    If you are not sure which role to choose, start with **Can Comment**. You can always increase permissions later.
