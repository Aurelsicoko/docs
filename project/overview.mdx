A **project** in Fimo represents a single website. Each project has its **own content, assets, code, and settings**. Projects are fully independent, so changes in one never affect another.

<Note>
    For technical users: under the hood, each project also has a dedicated database and storage bucket served through a CDN.
</Note>

## Why use projects?

- **One website per project** for clean separation  
- **Isolated data and settings** to keep work safe  
- **Start new ideas quickly** with a fresh canvas  
- **Unlimited projects** so you can build as many sites as you need
