<Warning>
  Custom domains are not available yet. This feature is on our roadmap.
</Warning>

With custom domains, you will be able to connect your own domain (for example, **www.yourbrand.com**) to your Fimo project.  

## Why use a custom domain?

  <Card title="Better SEO" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Search engines favor custom domains, improving visibility and ranking.

  <Card title="Memorable links" icon="link">
    Share a simple, easy-to-remember URL instead of a generated subdomain.

<Note>
For now, every site is published under a free **fimo.site** subdomain.  
Custom domains will give you more control and a fully branded experience.
