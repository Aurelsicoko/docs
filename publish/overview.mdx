Publishing is the final step to make your work public. In Fimo, you do not configure servers or pipelines. Click **Publish** in the top-right of your project and Fimo builds your site and makes it live, typically in under a minute.

## Key features

- **Builds and deploys** the current **Preview** state  
- **Creates a read-only snapshot** for Production  
- **Updates all pages and assets** in one go

<Note>
Your live site never changes until you publish. All edits remain in the preview window only.
</Note>
