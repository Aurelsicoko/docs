Publishing your project creates a live version of your site. It takes less than a minute and is always free.

## How to deploy?

- Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of your project.  
- Your site will be published at **xyz.fimo.site** (edit your subdomain in **Project Settings**)
- For a custom domain, see the [Custom domains](/publish/custom-domains) page.  

<Note>
Deployment is safe. Fimo creates a **read-only snapshot** of your preview database and builds a live version of your site from it.
</Note>

## What happens during deployment?

- Your site is built and optimized for production.  
- A snapshot of your preview database is saved.  
- Your content is published under your chosen domain.    

## What happens after deployment?

- A notification appears when deployment finishes.  
- Your site is live at the generated URL.  
- You can share the link with friends, colleagues, or customers.  

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why did my website fail to deploy?" icon="circle-question">
    This can happen if an error occurs during build. Copy the error message and paste it in the AI chat to understand and fix it. If the error persists, your site was not deployed successfully and reach out to support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my site not live after deployment?" icon="circle-question">
    This may happen if you have exceeded the free bandwidth limit (maximum free traffic allowed). You can still publish, but your site will remain offline until you upgrade.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I unpublish my site?" icon="circle-question">
    Yes. Go to your **Project Settings** page and choose to unpublish. Your preview environment stays intact and safe.
