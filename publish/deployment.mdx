Publishing your project creates a live version of your site. It takes less than a minute and is always free.

## How to deploy?

- Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of your project.  
- Optionally, edit your subdomain in **Project Settings**. Your site will be published at **xxxxxx.fimo.site**.  
- For a custom domain, see the [Custom domains](/publish/custom-domains) page.  

<Note>
Deployment is safe. Fimo creates a **read-only snapshot** of your preview database and builds a live version of your site from it.
</Note>

## What happens during deployment?

- Your site is built and optimized for production.  
- A snapshot of your preview database is saved.  
- Your content is published under your chosen domain.  
- The whole process usually completes in under a minute.  

## What happens after deployment?

- A notification appears when deployment finishes.  
- Your site is live at the generated URL.  
- You can share the link with friends, colleagues, or customers.
